Lilia stands as an advanced roleplay gamemode framework for Garry's Mod, meticulously crafted to provide a stable, feature-rich, and open-source platform. Drawing inspiration from Lillia, a character in League of Legends who resides in people's dreams and aims to fulfill their desires, Lilia similarly aims to help users fulfill their dreams of creating immersive roleplay servers. It's designed to be heavily customizable and easy to create content for, allowing users to focus on bringing their visions to life.
