# Lilia Framework Hooks

Comprehensive hook system for the Lilia framework.

---

## Overview

The Lilia framework provides an extensive hook system that allows developers

to extend and customize the gamemode's behavior. Hooks are categorized into

three main types: Server-side hooks, Client-side hooks, and Shared hooks.



All hooks follow the standard Garry's Mod hook system and can be overridden

or extended by addons and modules to customize the framework's behavior.
