# Menu Library

Interactive 3D context menu system for world and entity interactions in the Lilia framework.

---

Overview

The menu library provides a comprehensive context menu system for the Lilia framework. It enables the creation of interactive context menus that appear in 3D world space or attached to entities, allowing players to interact with objects and perform actions through a visual interface. The library handles menu positioning, animation, collision detection, and user interaction. Menus automatically fade in when the player looks at them and fade out when they look away, with smooth animations and proper range checking. The system supports both world-positioned menus and entity-attached menus with automatic screen space conversion and boundary clamping to ensure menus remain visible and accessible.
