# Notice Library

Player notification and messaging system for the Lilia framework.

---

Overview

The notice library provides comprehensive functionality for displaying notifications and messages to players in the Lilia framework. It handles both server-side and client-side notification systems, supporting both direct text messages and localized messages with parameter substitution. The library operates across server and client realms, with the server sending notification data to clients via network messages, while the client handles the visual display of notifications using VGUI panels. It includes automatic organization of multiple notifications, sound effects, and console output for debugging purposes. The library also provides compatibility with Garry's Mod's legacy notification system.
