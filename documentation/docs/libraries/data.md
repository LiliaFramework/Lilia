# Data Library

Data persistence, serialization, and management system for the Lilia framework.

---

Overview

The data library provides comprehensive functionality for data persistence, serialization, and management within the Lilia framework. It handles encoding and decoding of complex data types including vectors, angles, colors, and nested tables for database storage. The library manages both general data storage with gamemode and map-specific scoping, as well as entity persistence for maintaining spawned entities across server restarts. It includes automatic serialization/deserialization, database integration, and caching mechanisms to ensure efficient data access and storage operations.
