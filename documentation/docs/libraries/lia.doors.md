Overview

The doors library provides comprehensive door management functionality including
preset configuration, database schema verification, and data cleanup operations.
It handles door data persistence, loading door configurations from presets,
and maintaining database integrity. The library manages door ownership, access
permissions, faction and class restrictions, and provides utilities for door
data validation and corruption cleanup. It operates primarily on the server side
and integrates with the database system to persist door configurations across
server restarts. The library also handles door locking/unlocking mechanics and
provides hooks for custom door behavior integration.
