# Keybind Library

Keyboard binding registration, storage, and execution system for the Lilia framework.

---

Overview

The keybind library provides comprehensive functionality for managing keyboard bindings in the Lilia framework. It handles registration, storage, and execution of custom keybinds that can be triggered by players. The library supports both client-side and server-side keybind execution, with automatic networking for server-only keybinds. It includes persistent storage of keybind configurations, user interface for keybind management, and validation to prevent key conflicts. The library operates on both client and server sides, with the client handling input detection and UI, while the server processes server-only keybind actions. It ensures proper key mapping, callback execution, and provides a complete keybind management system for the gamemode.
