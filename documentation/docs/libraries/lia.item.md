Overview

The item library provides comprehensive functionality for managing items in the Lilia framework. It handles item registration, instantiation, inventory management, and item operations such as dropping, taking, rotating, and transferring items between players. The library operates on both server and client sides, with server-side functions handling database operations, item spawning, and data persistence, while client-side functions manage item interactions and UI operations. It includes automatic weapon and ammunition generation from Garry's Mod weapon lists, inventory type registration, and item entity management. The library ensures proper item lifecycle management from creation to deletion, with support for custom item functions, hooks, and data persistence.
