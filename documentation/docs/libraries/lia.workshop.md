Overview

The workshop library provides comprehensive functionality for managing Steam Workshop addons in the Lilia framework. It handles automatic downloading, mounting, and management of workshop content required by the gamemode and its modules. The library operates on both server and client sides, with the server gathering workshop IDs from modules and mounted addons, while the client handles downloading and mounting of required content. It includes user interface elements for download progress tracking and addon information display. The library ensures that all required workshop content is available before gameplay begins.
