The option library provides comprehensive functionality for managing user-configurable settings in the Lilia framework. It handles the creation, storage, retrieval, and persistence of various types of options including boolean toggles, numeric sliders, color pickers, text inputs, and dropdown selections. The library operates on both client and server sides, with automatic persistence to JSON files and optional networking capabilities for server-side options. It includes a complete user interface system for displaying and modifying options through the configuration menu, with support for categories, visibility conditions, and real-time updates.
