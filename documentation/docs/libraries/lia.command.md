Overview

The commands library provides comprehensive functionality for managing and executing commands in the Lilia framework. It handles command registration, argument parsing, access control, privilege management, and command execution across both server and client sides. The library supports complex argument types including players, booleans, strings, and tables, with automatic syntax generation and validation. It integrates with the administrator system for privilege-based access control and provides user interface elements for command discovery and argument prompting. The library ensures secure command execution with proper permission checks and logging capabilities.
