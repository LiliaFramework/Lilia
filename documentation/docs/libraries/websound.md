Overview

The websound library provides comprehensive functionality for managing web-based audio content in the Lilia framework. It handles downloading, caching, validation, and playback of sound files from HTTP/HTTPS URLs, with automatic local storage and retrieval. The library operates on both server and client sides, providing seamless integration with Garry's Mod's sound system through enhanced versions of sound.PlayFile, sound.PlayURL, and surface.PlaySound functions. It includes robust URL validation, file format verification, caching mechanisms, and statistics tracking. The library ensures optimal performance by avoiding redundant downloads and providing fallback mechanisms for failed downloads while maintaining compatibility with existing sound APIs.
