Overview

The player interaction library provides comprehensive functionality for managing player interactions and actions within the Lilia framework. It handles the creation, registration, and execution of various interaction types including player-to-player interactions, entity interactions, and personal actions. The library operates on both server and client sides, with the server managing interaction registration and validation, while the client handles UI display and user input. It includes range checking, timed actions, and network synchronization to ensure consistent interaction behavior across all clients. The library supports both immediate and delayed actions with progress indicators, making it suitable for complex interaction systems like money transfers, voice changes, and other gameplay mechanics.
