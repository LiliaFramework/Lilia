# Attributes Library

Character attribute management system for the Lilia framework.

---

## Overview

The attributes library provides functionality for managing character attributes in the Lilia framework. It handles loading attribute definitions from files, registering attributes in the system, and setting up attributes for characters during spawn. The library operates on both server and client sides, with the server managing attribute setup during character spawning and the client handling attribute-related UI elements. It includes automatic attribute loading from directories, localization support for attribute names and descriptions, and hooks for custom attribute behavior.

### loadFromDir

**Purpose**

Loads attribute definitions from a specified directory and registers them in the attributes system

**When Called**

During gamemode initialization or when loading attribute modules

**Parameters**

* `directory` (*string*): The directory path to search for attribute files

**Returns**

* None (modifies lia.attribs.list)

**Realm**

Shared

**Example Usage**

**Low Complexity:**
```lua
-- Simple: Load attributes from a single directory
lia.attribs.loadFromDir("gamemode/attributes")

```

**Medium Complexity:**
```lua
-- Medium: Load attributes with conditional directory checking
local attrDir = "gamemode/attributes"
if file.Exists(attrDir, "LUA") then
    lia.attribs.loadFromDir(attrDir)
end

```

**High Complexity:**
```lua
-- High: Load attributes from multiple directories with error handling
local attributeDirs = {"gamemode/attributes", "modules/attributes", "plugins/attributes"}
for _, dir in ipairs(attributeDirs) do
    if file.Exists(dir, "LUA") then
        lia.attribs.loadFromDir(dir)
        else
            print("Warning: Attribute directory not found: " .. dir)
        end
    end

```

### setup

**Purpose**

Sets up attributes for a client's character by calling OnSetup hooks for each registered attribute

**When Called**

When a client spawns or when their character is created

**Parameters**

* `client` (*Player*): The client whose character attributes need to be set up

**Returns**

* None

**Realm**

Server

**Example Usage**

**Low Complexity:**
```lua
-- Simple: Setup attributes for a client
lia.attribs.setup(client)

```

**Medium Complexity:**
```lua
-- Medium: Setup attributes with validation
if IsValid(client) and client:IsPlayer() then
    lia.attribs.setup(client)
end

```

**High Complexity:**
```lua
-- High: Setup attributes with custom logic and error handling
hook.Add("PlayerSpawn", "SetupAttributes", function(client)
if not client:getChar() then return end
    timer.Simple(0.1, function()
    if IsValid(client) then
        lia.attribs.setup(client)
        print("Attributes set up for " .. client:Name())
    end
end)
end)
