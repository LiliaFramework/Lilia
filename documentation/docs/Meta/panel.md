The meta table operates primarily on the client side, with the server providing data that panels can listen to and display. It includes integration with the inventory system for inventory change notifications, character system for character data display, network system for data synchronization, and UI system for panel management. The meta table ensures proper panel event handling, inventory synchronization, UI updates, and comprehensive panel lifecycle management from creation to destruction.
