# Player Meta

Player management system for the Lilia framework.

---

Overview

The player meta table provides comprehensive functionality for managing player data, interactions, and operations in the Lilia framework. It handles player character access, notification systems, permission checking, data management, interaction systems, and player-specific operations. The meta table operates on both server and client sides, with the server managing player data and validation while the client provides player interaction and display. It includes integration with the character system for character access, notification system for player messages, permission system for access control, data system for player persistence, and interaction system for player actions. The meta table ensures proper player data synchronization, permission validation, notification delivery, and comprehensive player management from connection to disconnection.
