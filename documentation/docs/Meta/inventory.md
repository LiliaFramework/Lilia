# Inventory Meta

Inventory management system for the Lilia framework.

---

Overview

The inventory meta table provides comprehensive functionality for managing inventory data, item storage, and inventory operations in the Lilia framework. It handles inventory creation, item management, data persistence, capacity management, and inventory-specific operations. The meta table operates on both server and client sides, with the server managing inventory storage and validation while the client provides inventory data access and display. It includes integration with the item system for item storage, database system for inventory persistence, character system for character inventories, and network system for inventory synchronization. The meta table ensures proper inventory data synchronization, item capacity management, item validation, and comprehensive inventory lifecycle management from creation to deletion.
