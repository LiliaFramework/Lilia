# Item Meta

Item management system for the Lilia framework.

---

Overview

The item meta table provides comprehensive functionality for managing item data, properties, and operations in the Lilia framework. It handles item creation, data persistence, inventory management, stacking, rotation, and item-specific operations. The meta table operates on both server and client sides, with the server managing item storage and validation while the client provides item data access and display. It includes integration with the inventory system for item storage, database system for item persistence, and rendering system for item display. The meta table ensures proper item data synchronization, quantity management, rotation handling, and comprehensive item lifecycle management from creation to destruction.
