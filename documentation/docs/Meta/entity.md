# Entity Meta

Entity management system for the Lilia framework.

---

Overview

The entity meta table provides comprehensive functionality for extending Garry's Mod entities with Lilia-specific features and operations. It handles entity identification, sound management, door access control, vehicle ownership, network variable synchronization, and entity-specific operations. The meta table operates on both server and client sides, with the server managing entity data and validation while the client provides entity interaction and display. It includes integration with the door system for access control, vehicle system for ownership management, network system for data synchronization, and sound system for audio playback. The meta table ensures proper entity identification, access control validation, network data synchronization, and comprehensive entity interaction management for doors, vehicles, and other game objects.
