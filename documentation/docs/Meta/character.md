# Character Meta

Character management system for the Lilia framework.

---

Overview

The character meta table provides comprehensive functionality for managing character data, attributes, and operations in the Lilia framework. It handles character creation, data persistence, attribute management, recognition systems, and character-specific operations. The meta table operates on both server and client sides, with the server managing character storage and validation while the client provides character data access and display. It includes integration with the database system for character persistence, inventory management for character items, and faction/class systems for character roles. The meta table ensures proper character data synchronization, attribute calculations with boosts, recognition between characters, and comprehensive character lifecycle management from creation to deletion.
