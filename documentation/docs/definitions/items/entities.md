### Complete Item Example

Below is a comprehensive example showing how to define a complete item with all available properties and methods.

```lua
        ITEM.name = "Chair"

        ITEM.model = "models/props_c17/FurnitureChair001a.mdl"

        ITEM.desc = "A comfortable chair for sitting"

        ITEM.category = "entities"

        ITEM.entityid = "prop_physics"

        ITEM.health = 250  -- Item can take 250 damage before being destroyed

-- Basic item identification
    ITEM.name = "Chair"                                          -- Display name shown to players
    ITEM.model = "models/props_c17/FurnitureChair001a.mdl"       -- 3D model for the item
    ITEM.desc = "A comfortable chair for sitting"                -- Description text
    ITEM.category = "entities"                                   -- Category for inventory sorting
    ITEM.entityid = "prop_physics"                               -- Entity class to spawn when placed
    ITEM.health = 250                                            -- Health when dropped (default: 100)
