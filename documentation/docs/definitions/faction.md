# Faction Definitions

Character faction definition system for the Lilia framework.

---

## Overview

The faction system provides comprehensive functionality for defining character factions within the Lilia framework.
Factions represent the main organizational units that characters belong to, serving as parent containers for classes.
Each character belongs to exactly ONE faction and can have multiple classes within that faction.
**Faction-Class Relationship:**
- **Factions** are the main organizational units (Citizens, Police, Medical, Staff)
- **Classes** are sub-divisions within factions (Officer, Detective, Captain within Police)
- Each character belongs to exactly ONE faction but can switch between classes within that faction
- **CLASS settings overpower FACTION settings** - any property defined in a class takes precedence
over the same property in the parent faction.
**Example Hierarchy:**
```
Faction: Police Department
├── Class: Police Officer (inherits police models, weapons, color)
├── Class: Police Detective (inherits police properties, overrides with detective-specific items)
├── Class: Police Captain (inherits police properties, overrides with command-specific permissions)
└── Class: SWAT Officer (inherits police properties, overrides with tactical gear)
```
Factions are defined using the FACTION table structure, which includes properties for identification,
visual representation, gameplay mechanics, and access control. The system includes callback methods
that are automatically invoked during key character lifecycle events, enabling dynamic behavior and
customization.
Factions can have player limits, whitelist requirements, specialized loadouts, and attribute
modifications that affect gameplay. The system supports modifying player health, armor, movement
speeds, model scale, weapons, and NPC relationships, providing a flexible foundation for role-based
gameplay systems.
**Player Management:**
Factions support player limits (absolute or percentage-based), character restrictions (one character
per player), custom name generation templates, and custom limit checking logic for advanced access
control scenarios.
**Access Control:**
Factions use the `isDefault` property to determine if they are accessible to all players, and can
implement custom permission logic through whitelist systems and the framework's permission system.
In addition to the FACTION table properties, factions can also modify character variables such as
classwhitelists to control which classes a character has access to within the faction.
