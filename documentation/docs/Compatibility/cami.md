Overview

The CAMI compatibility module enables seamless integration with the Common Admin Mod Interface, providing a standardized way to handle user groups, privileges, and admin access across different admin mods.
The module operates on both server and client sides to synchronize user group information, handle privilege registration, and manage access control through CAMI hooks.
It includes caching mechanisms for performance optimization and automatic synchronization of user group changes with the database.
The module integrates with Lilia's administrator system to provide unified admin functionality across different admin mods.
