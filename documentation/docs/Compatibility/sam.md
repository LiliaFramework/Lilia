Overview

The SAM compatibility module enables seamless integration with the Server Administration Mod, providing a bridge between SAM's admin commands and Lilia's permission system.
The module operates on the server side to handle admin command execution, permission validation, and staff duty integration for SAM commands.
It includes comprehensive command mapping for kick, ban, mute, gag, freeze, slay, and other administrative actions with proper permission checking.
The module integrates with Lilia's staff system to enforce duty requirements and faction restrictions for admin command usage.
