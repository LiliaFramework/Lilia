Overview

The Sit Anywhere compatibility module enables flexible seating functionality through the Sit Anywhere addon, allowing players to sit on various surfaces and objects.
The module operates on both server and client sides to configure sitting permissions, prevent sitting on restricted entities, and provide enhanced third-person view for sitting players.
It includes server-side configuration for anti-abuse measures, weapon restrictions in seats, and prop surfing prevention.
The module integrates with Lilia's permission system and provides custom view calculations for improved sitting experience.
