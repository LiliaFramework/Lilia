Overview

The PAC3 compatibility module enables seamless integration with the Player Appearance Customizer 3 addon, allowing players to customize their character appearance through wearable parts and accessories.
The module operates on both server and client sides to synchronize PAC parts between players, handle part management, and integrate with Lilia's item system for persistent customization.
It includes network synchronization for real-time part updates, automatic part reset on player loadout changes, and integration with the item framework for purchasable customization options.
The module ensures proper part data handling and prevents unauthorized part usage through validation checks.
