Overview

The Wiremod compatibility module ensures secure and controlled usage of Wiremod's Expression 2 (E2) chips. It implements upload restrictions and validation for E2 code uploads.
The module operates on the server side to handle Expression 2 chip uploads, with built-in security measures that restrict uploads to administrators and donators only.
It includes validation for upload targets and proper error handling with user notifications for failed uploads.
The module integrates with Wiremod's notification system to provide feedback to users about upload status and security restrictions.
