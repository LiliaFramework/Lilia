Overview

The logger library provides comprehensive logging functionality for the Lilia framework, enabling detailed tracking and recording of player actions, administrative activities, and system events. It operates on the server side and automatically categorizes log entries into predefined categories such as character management, combat, world interactions, chat communications, item transactions, administrative actions, and security events. The library stores all log entries in a database table with timestamps, player information, and categorized messages. It supports dynamic log type registration and provides hooks for external systems to process log events. The logger ensures accountability and provides administrators with detailed audit trails for server management and moderation.
