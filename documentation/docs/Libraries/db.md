Overview

The database library provides comprehensive database management functionality for the Lilia framework. It handles all database operations including connection management, table creation and modification, data insertion, updates, queries, and schema management. The library supports SQLite as the primary database engine with extensible module support for other database systems. It includes advanced features such as prepared statements, transactions, bulk operations, data type conversion, and database snapshots for backup and restore operations. The library ensures data persistence across server restarts and provides robust error handling with deferred promise-based operations for asynchronous database queries. It manages core gamemode tables for players, characters, inventories, items, configuration, logs, and administrative data while supporting dynamic schema modifications.
