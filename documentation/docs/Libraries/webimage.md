Web-based image downloading, caching, and management system for the Lilia framework.

---

Overview

The web image library provides comprehensive functionality for downloading, caching, and managing web-based images in the Lilia framework. It handles automatic downloading of images from URLs, local caching to improve performance, and seamless integration with Garry's Mod's material system. The library operates on both server and client sides, with intelligent caching mechanisms that prevent redundant downloads and ensure images are available offline after initial download. It includes URL validation, file format detection, and automatic directory management for organized storage. The library also provides hooks for download events and statistics tracking. Images are stored in the data/lilia/webimages/ directory and can be accessed through various path formats for maximum compatibility with existing code.
