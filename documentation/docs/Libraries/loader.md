# Loader Library

Core initialization and module loading system for the Lilia framework.

---

Overview

The loader library is the core initialization system for the Lilia framework, responsible for managing the loading sequence of all framework components, modules, and dependencies. It handles file inclusion with proper realm detection (client, server, shared), manages module loading order, provides compatibility layer support for third-party addons, and includes update checking functionality. The library ensures that all framework components are loaded in the correct order and context, handles hot-reloading during development, and provides comprehensive logging and error handling throughout the initialization process. It also manages entity registration for weapons, tools, effects, and custom entities, and provides Discord webhook integration for logging and notifications.
