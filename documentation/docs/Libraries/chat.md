Overview

The chatbox library provides comprehensive functionality for managing chat systems in the Lilia framework. It handles registration of different chat types (IC, OOC, whisper, etc.), message parsing and routing, distance-based hearing mechanics, and chat formatting. The library operates on both server and client sides, with the server managing message distribution and validation, while the client handles parsing and display formatting. It includes support for anonymous messaging, custom prefixes, radius-based communication, and integration with the command system for chat-based commands.
