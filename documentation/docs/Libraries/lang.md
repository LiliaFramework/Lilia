# Languages Library

Internationalization (i18n) and localization system for the Lilia framework.

---

Overview

The languages library provides comprehensive internationalization (i18n) functionality for the Lilia framework. It handles loading, storing, and retrieving localized strings from language files, supporting multiple languages with fallback mechanisms. The library automatically loads language files from directories, processes them into a unified storage system, and provides string formatting with parameter substitution. It includes functions for adding custom language tables, retrieving available languages, and getting localized strings with proper error handling. The library operates on both server and client sides, ensuring consistent localization across the entire gamemode. It supports dynamic language switching and provides the global L() function for easy access to localized strings throughout the codebase.
