# Panel Reference


This document describes every custom panel bundled with **Lilia**. Each entry lists the base Garry's Mod panel it derives from, a short description of its purpose, and a small code snippet demonstrating typical usage.

## Overview


Panels provide the building blocks for Lilia's user interface. Most derive from common Source engine panels such as `DFrame` or `DPanel` and extend them with additional behaviour. Use these panels when creating new menus or modifying existing ones.
