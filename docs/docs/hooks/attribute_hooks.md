# Attribute Hooks


This document lists hooks related to attribute setup and changes.


---


## Overview


Attributes can define their own hooks to react when a player's attribute is created or its value changes. Implement these functions on the `ATTRIBUTE` table to run custom logic. All hooks are optional; if a hook is omitted the default behavior is used.

### OnSetup


```lua
function ATTRIBUTE:OnSetup(client, value)

    if value > 5 then
        client:ChatPrint("You feel your strength surging!")

    else
        client:ChatPrint("Your muscles ache from weakness...")
    end
end
