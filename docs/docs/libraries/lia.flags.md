# Flags Library


This page explains permission flag management.

## Overview


The flags library assigns text-based permission flags to players. It offers tools for checking whether a player possesses a flag and for saving or loading flag data. Flags grant characters extra abilities but are often best replaced with in-character checks when possible.
