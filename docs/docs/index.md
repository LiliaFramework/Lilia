Lilia is an advanced roleplay framework for Garry's Mod. Inspired by Lillia from League of Legends, it lets you create immersive servers with stability, rich features, and open-source flexibility. Because Lilia is only a framework, you must install a roleplay schema and launch your server using that schema's gamemode (for example, `+gamemode scprp`).


## Server Owners


If you're looking to get your Lilia server up and running as soon as possible, check out the [Installation Tutorial](./installation.md) guide in the manual.

## Contributing


Lilia is still early in its lifespan, and there are still a few things missing here and there. Contributions to the documentation—from function references to simple typo fixes—are welcomed!


If you'd like to contribute code, you can visit the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/LiliaFramework/Lilia/) and make a pull request.


## Learning


Getting started with developing using the Lilia framework requires an intermediate level of Garry's Mod Lua knowledge. You'll want to learn the basics before you start making a schema. The [Garry's Mod Wiki](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/) is a good place to start.
