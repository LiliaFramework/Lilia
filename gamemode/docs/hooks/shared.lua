    Overview:
    Shared hooks in the Lilia framework handle functionality that needs to be available 
    on both client and server. These hooks are executed on both sides and are typically 
    used for data synchronization, shared utilities, and cross-realm functionality. 
    All shared hooks follow the standard Garry's Mod hook system and can be overridden 
    or extended by addons and modules.
