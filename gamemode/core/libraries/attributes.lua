    lia.attribs.loadFromDir(directory)

    Description:
        Loads attribute definitions from the given folder. Files prefixed
        with "sh_" are treated as shared and loaded on both client and
        server. The ATTRIBUTE table returned from each file is stored in
        lia.attribs.list using the filename, without prefix or extension,
        as the key.

    Parameters:
        directory (string) – Path to the folder containing attribute Lua files.

    Realm:
        Shared

    Returns:
        None

        Description:
            Initializes attribute data for a client's character. Each attribute in
            lia.attribs.list is read from the character and, if the attribute has
            an OnSetup callback, it is executed with the current value.

        Parameters:
            client (Player) – The player whose character attributes should be set up.
